Very excited to announce that I will be a guest artist at the next episode of Underground Art Bar, performing with my partner, Claire Farrell! 

This is a super cool initiative by Chris Love, and is a loose collection of art pieces and performances that are meant to elicit unforgettable moments- the type of stuff that art really is all about.

Tickets are on sale now, and are strictly limited- the venue is in an underground... thing, and has a limited capacity. Don't miss out!
