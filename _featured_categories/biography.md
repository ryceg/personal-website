## Long Bio

Rhys Gray is a Hobart based composer and performer known for his polystylism stemming from a broad range of influences. He is a current post-graduate student of the University of Tasmania, and holds both a Bachelor of Music with First Class Honours and an Associateâ€™s Degree in Music Studies from the University of Tasmania, where he studied with Dr. Maria Grenfell and Dr. Scott McIntyre.

Rhys composes for the concert hall, stage, screen, and computers. Irreverent and unafraid to eschew convention, his music pulses unpredictably, and plays on expectations. His works have been performed by the Australian String Quartet, Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra, Second Echo Ensemble, and many solo artists. Rhys enjoys collaborative and cross-discipline work, and is a regular fixture in musical theatre pits in Hobart.
