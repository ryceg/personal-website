Whew! Just wrapped up Season 1, Episode 2 of the Underground ArtBar, playing 'Clathrate Gun Hypothesis' with my very talented partner Claire Farrell.
This was a really fun project, and the first time that I put my double bass skills to use, as well as my first test of Max MSP live in a performance setting. 

I might put up a post detailing the way the Max patch worked. Stay tuned for audio.
