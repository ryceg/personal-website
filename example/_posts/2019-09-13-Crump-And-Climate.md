The world seems to be telling me to appreciate nature more- I just finished engraving another work for a previous client, Steve Crump, who writes beautiful music about the Tarkine, Tasmania, and is a frequent collaborator with Bob Brown, and I also attended the Climate Rally in Hobart. 

20,000 people apparently attended- that's bloody impressive for a state of half a million, and equates to almost 10% of Hobartians. Less in practice, as some probably came in from surrounding areas, but we'll pretend that it was one in ten. 

According to some researchers, the critical mass for peaceful protesters is to get 3.5% of the population protesting. In all studied protests where they reached that threshold, the demands of the protestors were met fully within a year. Let's hope that's the case this time.
