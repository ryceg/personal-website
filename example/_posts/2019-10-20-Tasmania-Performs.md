Delighted to announce that Claire and I have been selected for the Tasmania Performs Tarraleah Artists' Residency! This is a weekend of workshops, group activities, and general fun stuff that will help develop our upcoming project for the Underground ArtBar (and perhaps other things, too- who knows?)
