I'm painfully aware that my presence online has been somewhat lacking.

I am still alive, and have been busy working away at my exegesis, which is titled __Harmonic Based Extended Techniques and their Compositional Applications__. A very dry title, but some fascinating subject matter, which has been a lot of fun to research.

[Eigengrau's Generator](https://www.eigengrausgenerator.com) has laid dormant, which is tragically unfair to the people that were hoping that it'd catch up to a more modern framework sooner rather than later. Hopefully in the break I'll get a chance to do some work on it.
