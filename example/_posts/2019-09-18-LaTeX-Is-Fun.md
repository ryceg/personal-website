I've been doing my thesis in LaTex, which has been a challenging learning curve, but well worth it- the results have been incredible, and it has been a joy to use. 

I will upload a tutorial on how to use LaTex, together with a Pomodoro, and todo list integration once my thesis is finished. I'm unfortunately falling a little behind, so am hesitant to waste any time on non-essential tasks!
