Wow.


*Wow*.

Dear reader, I really really hope that you had the fortune to see NEON, because it was *incredible*. 

Angela Barnard brought my piece to *life*, using lasers, vests, and the most imaginative storytelling I've ever seen- I genuinely had no idea choregraphy could be so incredibly moving.

This has been an unforgettable experience, and I can't wait to see the finished documentary, and share the recordings with you.

Honours is going well, if a little bit slow. Hopefully it'll pick up in pace!
