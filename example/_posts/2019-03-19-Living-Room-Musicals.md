Another summer project that I have been working on is the __Living Room Musicals__ project, spearheaded by Dr. Asher Warren. I composed a musical number (as in, song and dance musical work- nothing eclectic or crazy about it, just honest to god normal chords for normal people!), which will be included as part of the flagship launch!
