Had a great day in the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra studio, recording my work __Krypton__, which will be played as part of DRILL's 2019 season "NEON"! Twelve instruments, twenty minutes, and an afternoon of wonderful music making- Greg Stephens did an amazing job (as always), and the entire process was documented by the DRILL team for a doco about the whole production. Pics will be forthcoming.
