Here is my bread recipe.

### Ingredients
* 6 cups of flour (the more wholemeal, the more water is needed)
* 4-6 cups of water (as above, how much water is dependent on a number of factors)
* 1 teaspoon of salt
* 1/2 teaspoon of yeast


### Instructions
1. Combine dry ingredients in a bowl that has lots of room for rising.
2. Add 4 cups of water, and continue adding water in half cups until the dough isn't a dough, as much as it is a very very thick sauce- you should be looking for pancake batter consistency that you're able to pour.
3. Cover and let it rise at room temperature for 8 hours, up to 18.
4. Knock the air out of the dough, which should have risen considerably, and let it rest for half an hour.
5. While that happens, preheat an oven to 220 celsius with a dutch oven and lid inside it.
6. After the oven has heated, take the dutch oven out, place on a heat-safe mat, and spray olive oil.
7. Pour the 'dough' into the dutch oven, put the lid back on, and put it into the oven.
8. Bake for 30 minutes with the lid on, then remove the lid, and bake for an additional 30 minutes.
9. Remove from the oven, pry the bread out of the dutch oven (carefull!) and let it cool completely on a wire rack.
10. Serve.
